            <p>
              I admire Micheal Crichton. Crichton was an author most famous for
              writing Jurassic Park, but Crichton was much more than an author;
              he studied as a doctor at Harvard Medical school, produced and
              wrote the TV show ER, which won 116 awards, and he programmed
              computer games. Crichton is the only person to be the creator of
              the top book, movie and TV show in a single year… which he did
              twice… consecutively. As such, he has not only mastered a single
              craft but many. Crichton also mastered many technical disciplines;
              he lectured anthropology at Cambridge University, pioneered visual
              effects (winning him an Oscar) as well as programmed two computer
              games and movie budging software.

              <br />
              <br />
              I admire him because he was able to span many skill sets and
              bridge the gap between the creative and the technical. He showed
              extraordinary skills in bringing together science with creativity
              in many of his novels which tended to be techno-science fiction;
              in these, he was able to both create an engaging narrative and
              write about complex scientific topics.

          <h3>Bridging Gaps</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover left top"></div>
            <p>
              Bridging the technical-design gap is something I aspire to do as
              both a designer and scientist. Although my medium will be
              different, I think this is an important skill that can be
              transposed across all media. Additionally, I would like to develop
              my writing and communication skills. Although this is not a branch
              of design, it is very important for any designer who needs to work
              with a client or team.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <br />

            <p>
              Crichton’s approach to his writing was to start by talking to as
              many experts in relevant fields, then use the collective knowledge
              of those experts to create a realistic novel, and he went as far
              as too add footnotes to scientific papers in some of his fiction
              novels, and a multi-page reference section. I think this approach
              is an excellent idea as there are always experts in a field
              regardless of how niche it is, and the vast majority of the time,
              they would want to help people learn about their niche. Most
              projects will have elements of cross-disciplinarity. Therefore I
              would like to adopt this style in order to better understanding of
              the other disciplines in work.
