            <p>
              The basic plot of the story is that there is a student in an
              English class who gets bored while learning about poems so,
              strongly dislikes them. But then, in his own time, he discovers
              some great poems and develops an understanding as to why poems are
              great. He then attempts to write poems for years and years, never
              writing anything good and sinking into a deep depression, having
              an existential crisis.<br />
              One day, when he's getting old, he has a great plan for a poem,
              writes down the incredible poem and gets awarded the Nobel
              literature prize. While getting the award, he realises his life
              has not been a failure.

          <h3>Aging</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              The main character ages throughout the storyboard with his hair
              growing out, as he forgoes shaving during the failing writing
              stage. Then growing shorter as the hair loss kicks in.
              Additionally, his hair grows lighter as the story progresses. This
              is used to show the time scale of the plot, ensuring that it is
              taken over many decades.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br />
          <h3>Colour</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              The image is predominantly in greyscale except for a few things
              similar to "Schindler's List"
              <a href="#references">(Spielberg, 1993)</a>. I used hints of
              colour to highlight some important elements putting them at the
              top of the visual hierarchy. These elements are the book,
              lightbulb and the medal as they are life-changing moments for the
              main character. The colour also contrasts the greyscale of the
              rest of the storyboard to make the rest of it look sad.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br />
          <h3>Camera Angles</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              The <b>establishing shot</b> is a <b>wide-angle</b> used to set
              the scene of the classroom by using a <b>wide-angle</b> rather
              than an <b>extreme wide-angle</b> this makes the scale of the
              scene personal as it only focuses on the characters in the room.
              The camera then focuses on the main character using a
              <b>medium shot</b> showing "how they are interacting with the
              environment" <a href="#references">(Filippo, 2019)</a>. The over
              the shoulder shot in panel three allows the viewer to see what's
              on the page, and the complimenting <b>medium close up</b> on the
              character's reaction shows the facial expressions as detailed as
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next three panels show an <b>over the shoulder</b> shot of the
              character writing with more and more scraps of paper building up.
              This puts the viewer into a similar position as the main
              character, which makes the scene feel more relatable. The
              binge-drinking scene features a <b>close-up</b> shot to emphasise
              what the character is feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Panel eleven features an <b>extreme wide shot</b> this is used to
              show the scale of the movie has changed now that the main
              character has affected more than the people in the classroom.
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't have the best drawing skills, which means that the
              storyboard took me many hours to draw and compose. Additionally it
              still isn't the most visually pleasing. So if I were to redo this
              project, I would first improve my drawing skills so I could create
              better looking drawings and do them quicker as well.
