            <p>
              Our idea of creating a better enrolment system for University of
              Auckland students has received positive feedback from user
              interviews and from surveys which means it was a good problem to
              move forward with a specific way we could tackle this project. To
              solidify our plan, we created a 6-square problem space to analyse
              the feedback we received. The six sections we used were -
              "patterns", "we met", "surprises", "interested to learn",
              "tensions" and "it would make a big difference". We found that the
              "surprises" section and the "interested to learn" section had a
              huge overlap as they both refer to new information, which we did
              not expect. We initially created our brainstorm on paper as a
              group during the class session but then for the sack of
              readability and to make it easier to share - we re-created it on
              miro.<br />
              Once we had defined our problem space using the brainstorm, our
              group decided to create
              <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lRVsMJM=/"
                >a mind map and an AEIUO chart</a
              >, which would help us derive a good problem statement.

              Ayeon and I worked to create the AEIOU board on miro. The main
              activity is enrolling and finding more information about
              enrolment. This enrolment is mainly done by the students at their
              own homes while interacting with the website through their
              computer. The other activities and interactions would be to
              support that main activity. This would either be directly (for
              instance, a sub-activity) or, more indirectly, a background
              activity enabling the enrollment.

          <h3>The Mind Map</h3>

            <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/100/3.2/mindmap.png"
              />
              <div class="blog-overlay">
                <div class="font-size-10">Pretty Mind Map</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              I focussed on creating a mind map using
              <a href="https://coggle.it/diagram/YJj8dRUVXk5Wy2qr/t/enrolment"
                >Coggle</a
              >. The four sections which I focussed on were:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                the flaws of the current design using
                <a
                  href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"
                  >Nielsen's usability heuristics</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>the web pages which we would need to create</li>
              <li>the students' workflow and enrolment path</li>
              <li>
                the broad issues which repeatedly mentioned in interviews and
                our survey
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We found that students felt that there was lots of information
              that they thought was missing or would be good to have on the
              page, so this is listed in the "pages" section. Once we had
              created the mind map, we found that our specific focus area would
              be around usability and user experience, so we needed our problem
              statement to reflect this. We decided to stick with the problem
              statement which we derived last week -
              <b>creating a better enrolment experience for students</b>.<br />
            </p>
          </div>

          <br />
          <h3>How Might We...</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              We also Ideated to create a "how might we" HMW statement which
              would give a short problem statement and outline our area of
              focus. We iterated through a few different HMW statements from a
              few different perspectives, for example, "Boost enrolment rates by
              streamlining the enrolment experience." This HMW statement is from
              the University's perspective, which is aimed at money and higher
              enrolment rates. As a group, we felt that our focus was more on
              empowering the students to create more informed decisions.
              <br />
              Because of this, we merged and adapted a few of our HMW statements
              to form one which more accurately represented our goal and shifted
              to be from the students perspective. our final HMW statement is:
              <br />
              <br />
              how might we
              <b
                >Create a better enrolment experience for students by providing
                them more information about the courses and degree they’re
                enrolling in.</b
              >
              <br /><br />
              This perspective heavily focuses on the students' experience of
              enrolment and highlights we aim to provide more information to
              improve it.
