            <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>
            <p>
              Carrying on from my previous work of representing the fertility
              rate of New Zealand. This project is to represent some of the
              underlining factors as to why the fertility rate of New Zealand
              is where it is at now as well as explorer where it is heading
              and where it has come from. I will iterate over different
              designs to find an optimal way to make this as clear and
              engaging as possible.
              <br />
              I will also analyse some fo the factors and see how much they
              impact the fertility rate of a country and using the Demographic
              Transition Model (DTM), I will predict the vague future of how
              New Zealand's fertility rate is expected to change.
              <br />
              I will also reflect on my work and how I can improve it if I had
              more time and reflecting on the skills I have developed during
              this process of designing.

          <h3>Fertility Rate</h3>
          <p>
            Fertility rate is the average number of children born per woman.
            (assuming she were to live until the end of her reproductive
            life). Therefore if the fertility rate of a region is less than
            (or equal to) 2 births per woman (BPW), it is expected the
            population will shirk as there are more deaths than births. If the
            fertility rate is much greater than 2 (BPW) the population is
            expected to grow. And if the fertility rate is slightly more than
            2 (BPW), the population is expected to stay approximately the same
            (due to premature deaths).
            <br />
            As discussed in a
            <a href="https://des100.etinaude.dev/blogs/processing">previous blog post</a>
            New Zealand's fertility rate has been dropping. In 1920 the
            fertility rate was
            <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1033465/fertility-rate-new-zealand-1855-2020/">3.26 BPW</a>.
            This fell to
            <a href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/new-zealands-birth-rate-lowest-on-record-deaths-drop-in-2020">1.61
              BPW
            </a>
            in 2020.
            <br />
            Fertility rate is an important indicator for a country to compare
            it's self with others and determine (broadly) if it has good
            health.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>Fertility Factors</h3>
          <p>
            The fertility rate is influenced by many factors. Such as
            education, health care, quality of life and so on.
          </p>
          <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>
            Education is a very important aspect of fertility rate, as
            education improves the population becomes more aware the risks and
            responsibilities of having children.

            The graph above from
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">ourworldindata.org</a>
            [1] shows a strong inverse corelation between the number of years
            of education and the fertility rate. As sex education improves
            more people understand the reasons to use contraceptives, this
            makes education one of the largest factors influencing
            contraceptive prevalence.
            <br />
            Contraceptive has a fairly strong trend with fertility rate as
            shown the the graph below.

            An interesting study was done in Tanzania in 2013 by the US NHS
            [2]. In this study, the researchers found that there was wide
            spread misinformation about the use of condoms. One of the
            findings were that nearly half of the interview participants
            agreed with the statement "Small worms in new, unopened condoms
            cause HIV." [2] This shown the the table below. This is one
            example as to misinformation about contraceptives which hinder the
            use of condoms.

              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4>Labour Force</h4>
          <p>
            There is also a trend between the percent of women in the work
            force and the fertility rate. As more women enter the work force
            they have less time to spend working children and thus child birth
            drops in priority. And as work is a monetary source, while
            children are a monetary sink, some countries such as Japan have
            had to encourage more women to give birth with cash rewards [3].
            <br />
            This trend is not nearly as well defined as some of the other
            factors which could be for a few reasons, such as it being less of
            a factor or because it is not a factor at all, but instead other
            factors are influencing fertility rate and labour force
            participation.
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Health Care</h4>
          <p>
            Likely the biggest factor influencing fertility rate is health
            care. As health care improves children are more likely to survive
            longer and grow up. This then mean that women don't need to have
            multiple children to have a good chance of one of them living. And
            since most of them would live if they had good health care, if a
            woman still had many kids she would have to take care of them. As
            a result the fertility decreases as health care improves.
            <br />
            As health care isn't quantifiable by it self the graph below is of
            child mortality rate, which is one measure of the quality of
            health care.

              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4>Quality of Life</h4>
          <p>
            lastly another large factor influencing fertility rate is quality
            of life. As quality of life improves, the fertility rate decreases
            as a result. This is because the quality of life is a direct
            result of all the other factors combined, better health care,
            better education, better equality. As discussed in the previous
            paragraphs these all influence the fertility rate in different
            ways.
            <br />
            The graph below is of the fertility rate over the human
            development index (HDI). the HDI is a measure of the quality of
            life of a country. It is calculated using the life expectancy,
            average number of years in education and GDP per capita (adjusted
            for living cost) of a country. This is meant to give a good
            overview as to how a country is doing overall rolling many factors
            into one measure.

          <br />
          <h4>Other factors</h4>
          <p>
            Since fertility rate is a very broad indicator, there are many
            other factors to consider. For example, China had a very low
            fertility rate, due to the One-child-policy. It also doesn't take
            skewed demographics.
            <br />
            Despite having many edge cases, fertility rate useful as a metric
            to broadly look at a counties health and wellbeing.

        <h3>The Future of Fertility</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition">demographic transition model</a>[4], is a
            very basic predictive model of how a countries birth
            rates and death rates change over time. The model is split up into
            5 different stages which start with a high birth and death rate
            and then drop down at separate times to a low birth and death
            rate. This is explained in the section above about healthcare. New
            Zealand is currently in stage 4 of the DTM and is likely to
            progress to stage 5 soon.
            <br />
            During the first 3 stages of the DTM, the fertility rate is
            greater than 2 leading to an increasing population. During stage 4
            the fertility rate is less than 2 leading to a decreasing
            population. And during stage 5 the fertility rate settles around 2
            leading to a stable population. Of course a population can never
            be entirely stable but the DTM is a rough approximation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <br />
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
            <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/sketches.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            I created a range of sketches to explore the different factors and
            find different methods to represent them. These sketches were very
            low fidelity but gave a good idea to different approaches I would
            be able to take. I reached out to some peers, lecturers and
            friends to provide feedback on my ideas which the gladly gave. As
            shown below (each post it note is a different piece of feedback)
          </p>
          <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
            <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/feedback.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            From this I decided the best idea to move forward with would be
            lady pushing prams past and going into a range hospitals, each
            looking more sophisticate, representing the link to healthcare. So
            I iterated. From the feedback I received it seemed I should
            simplify the idea more. So I changed it from 5 hospitals to 3
            hospitals. I also removed the hospitals and instead showed the
            advancement of quality of life over time.
            <br />
            This way I would be able to show quality of life as a broad factor
            rather than one specific factor.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started by consulting an expert in pixel art as I am not an
            artist by any means and I needed some advice. Hes advice was very
            useful so I decided to trial it on creating a terraria character.
            This allowed me to learn about different techniques and how to use
            them to create pixel art. From this I started creating some assets
            using an online pixel art editor. Unfortunately it seemed that
            most of my feedback was that it was difficult to see how the art
            would link together in a loop. So I wasn't able to get much useful
            feedback on purely the assets. So I created a looped animation in
            processing.

            This iteration was good but didn't have any background images
            which made it look kind of bland. So I added some background
            images. I also changed the first lady to having 8 prams to having
            4 along side this I tested different frame rates to find which was
            best.

        </div>
        <p>
          After positive feedback I made the background assets more detailed.
          The past background became based on an early victorian/late
          industrial revolution factory setting. The modern day became based
          on the Auckland city skyline, based off a collection of reference
          images. So some of the larger building are depicted such as the
          Skytower, the Lumley Building and the Viro Building (along side
          others).
          <br />
          I made the assets of the ladies not outlined to fit with the design
          theme, This meant I had to change how I represented boundaries on
          elements such as their arms, for this instead of outlines I used
          shadows and slightly different shades.
          <br />
          I also had to optimise my code since processing is a notoriously
          slow language which meant that the speed of the animation was slow
          and inconsistent depending on how much it had to render.
        </p>
        <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
          <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/it2.gif" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In my 4th iteration I decided to instead of showing the past and
          future generally, to pick a specific time frame (in this case 100
          years), luckily my animations were relativity similar to styles
          representing 100 years ago and 100 years in the future, I just
          needed to adjust the number of prams to match the relevant dates. I
          also decided to fill in the bottom parts fo the screen to make it
          more exciting, to do this I made the grass field into a garden with
          a picket fence. I also added a building into the future panel as
          some feedback one the previous iteration suggested the third panel
          seemed a bit bland.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
          <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/it3.gif" />
        </div>

        <p>
          The feedback I received from the previous iteration was that it was
          the background was too distracting from the prams and it might be
          better to compose the image so the lady is walking on the bottom
          third rather than roughly in the middle. It was also suggested that
          I create a clearer distinction between the present and future skies
          since they skies were very similar colours.
          <br />
          To fix the visual hierarchy issue I increased the size of the
          sprites substantially. I shifted the whole image down which also
          reduced the amount of unused space for the fields, and made the
          modern sky a bit mirky firstly as a nod to air pollution lowering
          the quality of life and secondly to create a clear distinction
          between the present and future.
          <br />
          for performance reasons I also switched having 3 separate background
          image files which can easily be swapped out individually to having
          one background total. This does mean I need to draw more pixels each
          draw cycle but reduces the amount of time importing the files.

        <p>
          The feedback on this iteration was that it was clear to see that the
          technology of the times were influence the number of children women.
          Which was my final goal. I also received positive feedback about the
          aesthetics. One thing which was suggested but due to performance and
          time constraints I didn't implement was creating a parallax effect
          by moving some foreground assets slowly to the left, and the
          background assets to the right even slower. Although this would have
          looked very good, it would also distract form the lady with the
          prams, thus diluting my message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this project I have used a lot of different techniques to
          compose my designs and through many iterations ended up with a final
          concept that I was happy with.
