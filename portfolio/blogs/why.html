              <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>
              <p>
                Carrying on from my previous work of representing the fertility
                rate of New Zealand. This project is to represent some of the
                underlining factors as to why the fertility rate of New Zealand
                is where it is at now as well as explorer where it is heading
                and where it has come from. I will iterate over different
                designs to find an optimal way to make this as clear and
                engaging as possible.
                <br />
                I will also analyse some fo the factors and see how much they
                impact the fertility rate of a country and using the Demographic
                Transition Model (DTM), I will predict the vague future of how
                New Zealand's fertility rate is expected to change.
                <br />
                I will also reflect on my work and how I can improve it if I had
                more time and reflecting on the skills I have developed during
                this process of designing.

            <h3>Fertility Rate</h3>
            <p>
              Fertility rate is the average number of children born per woman.
              (assuming she were to live until the end of her reproductive
              life). Therefore if the fertility rate of a region is less than
              (or equal to) 2 births per woman (BPW), it is expected the
              population will shirk as there are more deaths than births. If the
              fertility rate is much greater than 2 (BPW) the population is
              expected to grow. And if the fertility rate is slightly more than
              2 (BPW), the population is expected to stay approximately the same
              (due to premature deaths).
              <br />
              As discussed in a
              <a href="https://des100.etinaude.dev/blogs/processing"
                >previous blog post</a
              >
              New Zealand's fertility rate has been dropping. In 1910 the
              fertility rate was
              <a
                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1033465/fertility-rate-new-zealand-1855-2020/"
                >3.63 BPW</a
              >. This fell to

                href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/new-zealands-birth-rate-lowest-on-record-deaths-drop-in-2020"
                >1.61 BPW
              </a>
              in 2020.
              <br />
              Fertility rate is an important indicator for a country to compare
              it's self with others and determine (broadly) if it has good
              health.

            <h3>Fertility Factors</h3>
            <p>
              The fertility rate is influenced by many factors. Such as
              education, health care, quality of life and so on.
            </p>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>
              Education is a very important aspect of fertility rate, as
              education improves the population becomes more aware the risks and
              responsibilities of having children.

              <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate"
                >ourworldindata.org</a
              >
              [1] shows a strong inverse corelation between the number of years
              of education and the fertility rate. As sex education improves
              more people understand the reasons to use contraceptives, this
              makes education one of the largest factors influencing
              contraceptive prevalence.
              <br />
              Contraceptive has a fairly strong trend with fertility rate as
              shown the the graph below.

              An interesting study was done in Tanzania in 2013 by the US NHS
              [2]. In this study, the researchers found that there was wide
              spread misinformation about the use of condoms. One of the
              findings were that nearly half of the interview participants
              agreed with the statement "Small worms in new, unopened condoms
              cause HIV." [2] This shown the the table below. This is one
              example as to misinformation about contraceptives which hinder the
              use of condoms.

            </div>
            <h4>Labour Force</h4>
            <p>
              There is also a trend between the percent of women in the work
              force and the fertility rate. As more women enter the work force
              they have less time to spend working children and thus child birth
              drops in priority. And as work is a monetary source, while
              children are a monetary sink, some countries such as Japan have
              had to encourage more women to give birth with cash rewards [3].
              <br />
              This trend is not nearly as well defined as some of the other
              factors which could be for a few reasons, such as it being less of
              a factor or because it is not a factor at all, but instead other
              factors are influencing fertility rate and labour force
              participation.
            </p>

                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Health Care</h4>
            <p>
              Likely the biggest factor influencing fertility rate is health
              care. As health care improves children are more likely to survive
              longer and grow up. This then mean that women don't need to have
              multiple children to have a good chance of one of them living. And
              since most of them would live if they had good health care, if a
              woman still had many kids she would have to take care of them. As
              a result the fertility decreases as health care improves.
              <br />
              As health care isn't quantifiable by it self the graph below is of
              child mortality rate, which is one measure of the quality of
              health care.
            </p>

              <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/mortality.png" />
              <div class="blog-overlay">

                  source:
                  <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate"
                    >https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate</a
                  >
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Quality of Life</h4>
            <p>
              lastly another large factor influencing fertility rate is quality
              of life. As quality of life improves, the fertility rate decreases
              as a result. This is because the quality of life is a direct
              result of all the other factors combined, better health care,
              better education, better equality. As discussed in the previous
              paragraphs these all influence the fertility rate in different
              ways.
              <br />
              The graph below is of the fertility rate over the human
              development index (HDI). the HDI is a measure of the quality of
              life of a country. It is calculated using the life expectancy,
              average number of years in education and GDP per capita (adjusted
              for living cost) of a country. This is meant to give a good
              overview as to how a country is doing overall rolling many factors
              into one measure.

            <br />
            <h4>Other factors</h4>
            <p>
              Since fertility rate is a very broad indicator, there are many
              other factors to consider. For example, China had a very low

              Despite having many edge cases, fertility rate useful as a metric

          <h3>The Future of Fertility</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              The
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition"
                >demographic transition model</a
              >[4], is a very basic predictive model of how a countries birth
              rates and death rates change over time. The model is split up into
              5 different stages which start with a high birth and death rate
              and then drop down at separate times to a low birth and death
              rate. This is explained in the section above about healthcare. New
              Zealand is currently in stage 4 of the DTM and is likely to
              progress to stage 5 soon.
              <br />
              During the first 3 stages of the DTM, the fertility rate is
              greater than 2 leading to an increasing population. During stage 4
              the fertility rate is less than 2 leading to a decreasing
              population. And during stage 5 the fertility rate settles around 2
              leading to a stable population. Of course a population can never
              be entirely stable but the DTM is a rough approximation.

          <h3>Sketches</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
              <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/sketches.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
              I created a range of sketches to explore the different factors and
              find different methods to represent them. These sketches were very
              low fidelity but gave a good idea to different approaches I would
              be able to take. I reached out to some peers, lecturers and
              friends to provide feedback on my ideas which the gladly gave. As
              shown below (each post it note is a different piece of feedback)
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
              <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/feedback.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
              From this I decided the best idea to move forward with would be
              lady pushing prams past and going into a range hospitals, each
              looking more sophisticate, representing the link to healthcare. So
              I iterated. From the feedback I received it seemed I should
              simplify the idea more. So I changed it from 5 hospitals to 3
              hospitals. I also removed the hospitals and instead showed the
              advancement of quality of life over time.
              <br />
              This way I would be able to show quality of life as a broad factor
              rather than one specific factor.

              I started by consulting an expert in pixel art as I am not an
              artist by any means and I needed some advice. Hes advice was very
              useful so I decided to trial it on creating a terraria character.
              This allowed me to learn about different techniques and how to use
              them to create pixel art. From this I started creating some assets
              using an online pixel art editor. Unfortunately it seemed that
              most of my feedback was that it was difficult to see how the art
              would link together in a loop. So I wasn't able to get much useful
              feedback on purely the assets. So I created a looped animation in
              processing.

            <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
              <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/demo.gif" />
            </div>
            <p>
              This iteration was good but didn't have any background images
              which made it look kind of bland. So I added some background
              images. I also changed the first lady to having 8 prams to having
              4 along side this I tested different frame rates to find which was
              best.

          <div class="blog-img-large hover left top">
            <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/it1.gif" />
          </div>
          <p>
            After positive feedback I made the background assets more detailed
            and made the assets of the ladies not outlined to fit with the
            theme, This meant I had to change how I represented boundaries on
            elements such as their arms. I also had to optimise my code since
            processing is a notoriously slow language which meant that the speed
            of the animation was slow and inconsistent depending on how much it
            had to render.

          <p>
            In my last iteration I decided to instead of showing the past and
            future generally, to pick a specific time frame (in this case 100
            years), luckily my animations were relativity similar to styles
            representing 100 years ago and 100 years in the future, I just
            needed to adjust the number of prams to match the relevant dates. I
            also decided to fill in the bottom parts fo the screen to make it
            more exciting. and .... // TODO
