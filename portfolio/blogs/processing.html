            <h3>Fertility rate</h3>
            <p>
              In the latest census stats NZ found that New Zealand's fertility
              rate fell from 1.71 (2018) to
              <a
                href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/new-zealands-birth-rate-lowest-on-record-deaths-drop-in-2020"
                >1.61 (2020)</a
              >
              births per woman (BPW). The fertility rate of a country is a very
              broad indicator of its general health and well being. According to
              the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition"
                >demographic transition model</a
              >, when a country improves its health, it reduces its death rate
              and decreases infant mortality rate. This then means that there is
              less of a need to replace the population and as such, the
              fertility rate also decreases. When the fertility rate drops to
              (or below) 2, a country is likely to be in stage 4 and nearing
              stage 5 of the demographic transition model.
            </p>
            <p>
              This shows that New Zealand has relatively and very broadly
              speaking good health and well being. The fertility rate shows the
              average number of children born to a woman across their lifetime.
              If the fertility rate is at or below 2.0, then the population will
              drop as there are not enough babies to replace the population. If
              the fertility rate is slightly above 2.0 then the population will
              stay stable (it cannot be exactly 2.0 to account for early
              deaths). If the fertility rate is much higher than 2.0 then the
              population will increase.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Other factors</h4>
            <p>
              Since the fertility rate is a very broad indicator, it doesn't
              take into account many considerations. For example, for many
              years, China had a very low fertility rate, not from good health
              care but rather from the One-child-policy. It also doesn't take
              into account population changes from immigration or skewed
              demographics.
              <br />
              Despite having many edge cases, fertility rate is still a useful
              metric to broadly look at a counties health. This is why I decided
              to create a visual representation of New Zealand's fertility rate.

              <br />
              <br />
              I started by creating a range of initial prototypes to find the
              best way to approach the problem. From this, I received lots of
              feedback from peers, as the last three prototypes were the more
              popular ideas. This was because they were seen as more novel and
              more interesting to watch. I further developed a higher fidelity
              prototype based on the cellular automata idea.

            </div>
            <h4>The Rule Set</h4>
            <p>
              The cellular automata I created was based on
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life"
                >Conway's game of life</a
              >. The game of life is a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game"
                >zero-player game</a
              >
              that is meant to create a very minimal and basic simulation of
              populations. Because of this link, I thought it was ideal for
              showing how populations change over time based on their fertility
              rate.
              <br />
              I created the rule set of this automata to be based on the
              fertility rate of New Zealand with a margin of error of less than
              1%. All my calculations and the rule set can be found on

            <h4>Automata(d) New Zealand</h4>
            <p>
              <br />
              Once I created the rule set, I made a hexagonal map of New Zealand
              to use as the grid for the game to be played on. This looked great
              but had a few flaws. Firstly it was reasonably accurate in showing
              how populations change and adapt, growing and shrinking based on
              the amount of land they have. Unfortunately, it didn't accurately
              show what New Zealand's population is doing right now for longer
              than a single frame. Secondly, it is fairly difficult to
              understand the data being represented without an in-depth
              explanation, which means the data is being represented poorly.
              Since representing the statistic is the ultimate goal of the
              project, this is more important than aesthetics. On top of this,
              after receiving some feedback, it was pointed out to me that my
              design didn't meet the assignment parameters.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>

            <div class="blog-img-medium hover right top">
              <img class="image" src="./../assets/240/second-iteration.gif" />
            </div>

            <h4>Meeting Parameters</h4>

            <p>
              <br />
              To meet the assignment parameters, I needed to create a
              1000px*1000px gif using only black and white, which meant that
              representing live cells, dead cells, and ocean cells would be very
              difficult. When I edited the programme to meet the requirements, I
              didn't like the aesthetic, which meant that it now neither looked
              good nor was it easy to understand.

            </div>

            <h4>New Automata</h4>
            <p>
              From this, I decided to create an entirely new automata using the
              New Zealand Grid. This automata is much simpler, and it is easier
              to understand. It randomly selects a portion of the population and
              removes them. This is repeated to show generations. While this did
              meet the requirements of the assignment and looked good, it gave
              the statistic a negative spin. It looked as though the entire
              population of New Zealand was about to be extinct in a few
              generations. As I am meant to merely represent the statistic so it
              would be easy to understand and not add my own opinions about
              whether that statistic is good or bad, I found this to be
              represented too much bias.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h3>Final Representation</h3>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover left top">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/240/a1-final.gif"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              After receiving lots of feedback on my different automata, I
              decided to do a full pivot. I changed from representing on an
              countrywide scale to a individual scale.
              <br />
              The gif is split into five stages.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The older generation exists and is stable.</li>
              <li>The first child is born.</li>
              <li>The second child is born.</li>
              <li>The older generation dies.</li>
              <li>The new generation replaces the old.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>
              This final representation shows just one generation of the
              fertility rate, which is good as it doesn't speculate as to how it
              will change or stay the same. Additionally, it is very clear to
              see the five stages of the animation and how the older generation
              is being replaced, but the resolution rate is not high enough to
              entirely replace the older generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This ended up being a much simpler idea to implement, looking good
              and representing the data well.
