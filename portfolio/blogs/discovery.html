              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              We were tasked to find a problem that we face as University of
              Auckland students in a group of four. To do this, we initially
              created a large brainstorm coming up with a wide range of ideas
              individually, then brought our ideas together and found that we
              each had some <b>common trends</b> running through the problems we
              faced.<br />
              We had all faced <b>transportation</b> issue when commuting into
              the city campus. We also all faced <b>navigation</b> issues while
              trying to find our next class around campus. And we had all faced
              a plethora of <b>enrolment</b> issues.<br />
              Since we all felt strongly about the three topics above, we
              narrowed the target problem down to those three, then even further
              filtered them to the enrolment issues; this will be the problem we
              decided to focus on.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br />
          <h3>The Problem</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover left top">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/100/3.1/problem.jpg"
              />
              <div class="blog-overlay">
                <div class="font-size-10">Defining the problem</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Once we found our topic, we struggled to define our problem well
              since there are so many issues students face when enrolling, but
              we found that it broke down into a few aspects.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Access to information</li>
              <li>Ease of navigation</li>
              <li>Clear degree structuring</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              So we decided to create a
              <b>better enrolment experience for students</b>.<br />
              For our observation, given the nature of the problem space, we
              <b>couldn't easily observe people</b> naturally encountering the
              problem since most people enrol at home and will enrol closer to
              the semester starting. So we had casual conversations with past
              and present university students to understand their feelings about
              the enrolment process; we also reflected as a group on our own
              experience while enrolling.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <h3>Initial problem analysis</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover top">
              <img
                class="image"

                src="../assets/100/3.1/calendar.png"

                  The "course calendar" where students currently get course
                  information
                  <div class="image-reference">
                    Credit: University of Auckland
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Since we had all faced this issue numerous times, we could easily
              pick up on many surface-level problems quickly from a casual
              conversation and find aspects to the design which we wished was
              improved. Amongst our group, we were able to do some peer
              interviews to get information about what we each liked and
              disliked and come up with an initial batch of ideas as to what was
              missing from the current design.
            </p>
            <p>
              We then concluded our class time by assigning tasks for us each to
              do by the next meeting. Two of us would perform empathy (3
              interviews each) conversations, while the other two would do
              secondary research and a survey. Although the assignment called
              for less than this, we felt that performing each of these tasks
              would be valuable for different aspects and would be useful to get
              a broader understanding of the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it was recommended that we have two people at each
              interview (one to write notes and one to ask the questions) due to
              unforeseen circumstances, we could not do this, so we did
              individual interviews instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              After conducting team interviews to understand what issues the
              team members face while enrolling and conducting
              <b>three brief, casual</b> interviews with current design
              students, I Performed <b>three in-depth</b>
              semi-formal interviews. Two interviewees were current students,
              and one was a past student, two studied computer science and one
              studied engineering.
            </p>

          <br />
          <h3>Observations and Insights</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <br />
            <p>The observations I found from my interviews were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Students struggle to understand which courses they need to
                complete.
              </li>
              <li>Students don't know what the course content will be.</li>
              <li>
                There is no access to which kinds of jobs a course is aimed
                towards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students worry they will need extra semesters if they pick the
                incorrect courses.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's hard to apply for concessions since the course coordinator
                isn't listed on the course calendar.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students have to cross-reference between many sources of
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                It takes a long time to enrol and pick courses for each
                semester.
              </li>
              <li>
                There's inconsistent information for past students about courses
              </li>
              <li>Students get lots of information from 3rd party sources</li>
              <li>
                Students feel frustrated when attempting to enrol into courses
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>And my insights were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Students want an easy, structured layout that presents basic
                info unless the user wants more in-depth information.
              </li>
              <li>Picking courses can feel overwhelming.</li>
              <li>
                Most students are happy following the most common degree path
                and most straightforward route if it means they know they've
                chosen the right courses.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there were a 1st party way to get information about a course,
                students would use it.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a large gap between what students need and what is
                currently being provided.
              </li>
            </ol>
