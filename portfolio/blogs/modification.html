                  Cabling caught behind threaded rod

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              We have two Anycubic 3d printers at home, which are great
              entry-level printers for an affordable price. Unfortunately, since
              the price is so low, it comes with a few fatal flaws. One of which
              occurs when printing very large objects; due to the way cabling is
              bent, there is a high chance of being caught behind a threaded
              pole. This means when the print head needs to move away from the
              pole, it can't. So often the print fails, which can be terrible
              for a 40-hour print. My project was to mitigate this point of
              failure before anyone used the printer for another big project.
              <br />
              <br />
              Luckily only big prints are affected by this flaw, so the solution
              to this problem could be solved with a small print!

          <h3>The Prototypes</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover left top">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/2.1/prototype_1.PNG"
              />
              <div class="blog-overlay">
                <div class="font-size-20">First Prototype</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              I created a few sketches of ideas to solve this issue and settled
              on a design which would clip on to the top of the printer and
              surround the threaded rod; I thought it would be easiest to
              continue ideating and sketching my designs in 3d so I could
              quickly refine it and have a visual representation of my model.
              Unfortunately, while designing this, I realised that it would take
              unnecessary filament and time to print, and it's always a good
              idea to refine and improve designs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <br />
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover top">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/2.1/prototype_2.PNG"
              />
              <div class="blog-overlay">
                <div class="font-size-20">Second Prototype</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              I then refined this idea by reducing the width by 50%, and instead
              of having a solid block of wasted filament, I created a raised
              holder for the rod. I was happy with this design's look but again
              realised that I could reduce the filament used by a considerable
              margin. It didn't need to fully clip on to the printer since it
              doesn't need to be very secure; after all, no force would be
              applied to it. This means I have a small clip slightly larger than
              the rod. My third prototype was finally small enough to be
              entirely happy with. But it shared another flaw with all the rest
              of the designs so far: they might increase friction on the rod. In
              the best-case scenario, it uses some extra electricity to drive
              the motors, and in the worst-case, it could ruin a long print.

          <h3>The Solution</h3>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <br />
            <div class="blog-img-small hover top left">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/2.1/prototype_4.PNG"
              />
              <div class="blog-overlay">
                <div class="font-size-20">Final Prototype</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              My final design was a small-cap that would fit on the top of the
              rod. This was very small, which means it used minimal filament and
              time (taking only 5 minutes to print). Additionally, it reduces
              the likelihood of interfering with the printhead. This design
              would also only touching the rod, which means there would be no
              extra friction. The rounded edges at the bottom both help make it
              look slightly better and make it substantially easier to insert
              the rod. The top was not rounded as that could help snag the
              cables between it and the top metal plate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <br />
            <div class="blog-img-medium hover top">
              <img
                class="image"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                src="../assets/2.1/solution.jpg"
              />
              <div class="blog-overlay">
                <div class="font-size-20">Final Solution</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              As you can see, the cables are now unable to get behind the rod
              and prevent the printer's movement, which means I am ready to
              print some larger projects!
              <br /><br />
              Overall this was a successful modification of the printer, and I
              will printer another one for the other printer as well. There are
              certainly improvements I could make by reducing the distance the
              rod fits into the cap, but this would only be by about 1mm since
              anything more could cause the cap to fall off during printing.
